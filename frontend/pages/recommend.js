  "introduction": "Decrease abandoned carts\nShipping Rates Calculator+ displays shipping costs to your customers in the shopping cart. It makes your customers feel more confident about the checkout process and increases the usability of your store.\nWhy should I display shipping rates in the shopping cart?\nAccording to the UPS Pulse of the Online Shopper Survey, \"44% of shoppers abandoned a cart because they wanted to get an idea of total costs (including shipping) to compare before buying\". When questioned about \"Reasons for abandoning shopping carts\", 34% answered, \"Shipping and handling costs were listed too late during the checkout process\". Showing shipping rates upfront is key because it reduces friction and enhances the customer experience.",
  "description": "How does it work?\nThe app auto-detects your customers' location using a precision IP database. It then queries the Shopify API to get the different shipping options for that location.\nHow are the shipping rates displayed?\nShipping rates are displayed on your shopping cart page, with a map showing the customer location and the option to select a different location.\nShipping Rates Calculator is mobile-friendly, adapting its size and layout to any screen size or device and its styles are automatically configured for most Shopify themes.\nDisplay delivery estimates\nIf real-time carriers are configured in your store, estimated delivery dates provided by your carrier are also displayed. Shopify offers carrier-calculated shipping rates for all stores in the US and Canada through USPS, FedEx, UPS, and Canada Post. Shipping Rates Calculator Plus app is the perfect match to show their delivery times!\nCompatibility with shipping apps\nShipping Rates Calculator Plus shows your store shipping rates and estimates as they are provided by the Shopify API. If you use a third-party advanced shipping or bespoke shipping app, our app will display its information as long as the app is integrated with the Shopify API as a Carrier Service.\nAbout Code Black Belt, the developers of Shipping Rates Calculator+\nWe are a mid-size company exclusively focused on Shopify App Development since 2014. We created some of the top apps on the Shopify App Store. Our values are great user experience, high quality code and exceptional support.",

  "introduction": "The Top-Rated Backup App\nRewind is the easiest way to backup your Shopify store and undo unwanted changes. Get peace of mind knowing that your most important store data is automatically backed up by Shopify's top-rated backup app.\nEvery day, Rewind backs up millions of items for merchants of all sizes. From small shops to Shopify Plus stores like Endy, MVMT Watches, and Gymshark.",
  "description": "Why Do You Need an Automatic Backup?\n\n    Even though Shopify backs up all its data, you don’t have access to those backups. When items are deleted in your store, they’re gone forever.\n    Doing a manual backup by exporting CSV files is a complicated, time-consuming process.\n    Some apps can delete or unintentionally edit items in your store. We’ve seen customer cases where an app integration deleted all their prices, inventory count, and more in seconds.\n    People make mistakes. Whether you’re editing code yourself or you hired a freelancer to work on your store, you’ll want the ability to undo a mistake instead of losing hours of work.\n\nThe Cost of Downtime\n\n    Countless dollars in lost sales\n    First-time visitors may never return\n    Hours of lost productivity and effort\n\nHow Rewind Works\n\nClick \"Add app\" to install Rewind and start your 7-day free trial. Select a plan, then sit back and relax. Rewind will backup your store every day and send you a weekly summary email.\nWhat Rewind Backs Up\n\nRewind backs up more item types than any other solution. This includes:\n\n    Products and Product Images\n    Customers\n    Orders, Collections\n    Blogs and Blog Posts\n    Pages\n    Themes and Theme Files\n    Menu Navigation\n    Store Policies\n    Locations\n    Shipping Zones\n    Gift Cards\n    Customer Saved Searches\n    Metadata (for Enterprise plans).\n\n\n\n",
